# TUK-SKT Industrial Datasets for Machine Learning
---
- TSID ( [TUK] - [SKT] Industrial Datasets ) is dataset for studying, benchmarking, etc., mainly in machine learning and smart-factory field. It contains multiple type of real simulation assetâ€™s data. All dataset is collected from well-designed experiments.
- Currently, two types of asset is opend. More types will be opend soon.

#### Stamping Press Machine
- The machine presses the aluminum coin to print a specific pattern.
- 5 types of data ( Pressure Limit, Actual Pressure, Adjust Speed, Deceleration Distatnce, Quality Score ) were collected every trials.
- _Data Field Description_
    - Pressure Limit
        - Configured value. The machine presses the coin with a specific pressure as per the pressure limit value.
    - Actual Pressure
        - Measured value. It was measured by the pressure sensor at pressing the coin.
    - Adjust Speed
        - Configured value.The machine presses the coin with a specific speed as per the adjust speed value.
    - Deceleration Distance
        - Configured value. The machine decelerates press speed when the distance between punch surface and coin surface are closer to a specific value as per the deceleration distance value.
    - Quality Score
        - Measured value. We measured the quality score applying canny edge method on a stamped coin picture.
        
#### Conveyor Belt System
